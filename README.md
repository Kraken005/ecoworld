A mobile application on recycling using google technologies Flutter and Firebase.
The lack of efficient and cost effective waste management systems has resulted in a growing enviournment crisis in many parts of the world.While recycling pograms exists in many cities, they are often inefficient and difficult to access for many citizens. Furthurmore the lack of awareness and education on the importance of recycling has lead to the ignorance of this issue.

To arouse the interest of people toward recycling we have made a mobile application on waste management through recycling. The objective of this project is to make recycling easily accessable and profitable to people. Our app encourages citizens to recycle and also provide resources to educate people on the importance of recycling by informing them on the various recycling events and programs.
This appliation touches upon some aspects of recycling. We have implemented our app through some pages linked together to guide the users throughout their time using the app.

 The key features of our app are:

 1.Community page: This page comprises of the updates on various events and programs associated to waste management. Community programs and drives have always been a huge influence on the pressing social issues. The purpose of these events fascinated people to participate in these. Community page displays the current events or programs related to waste management that are happening or are scheduled for the future with detailed information about the venue,date and time organised by governmental or non-governmental agencies. This awakes an interest in the user and influences them to take part in it and be a reason for a substainable society. Some of the contents in this page includes domestic methods for recycling their items at home. Thus educating the user on the easy and  affordable methods of recycling their wastes at home.

 2.Selling page: The selling page of this application is a user interactive page where the user can sell their respective waste items which are capable of being recycled. User have to give the details of their waste items like the type and quantity of waste following which a scrap dealer will be assigned to collect the waste materials.  If the user wants to self visit the recycling center, this app helps them locate the recycle centers in their vicinity. This way recycling will be a convenient procedure for those who cannot take some time out of their busy schedule to recycle their waste products and those who are less aware of these centers.
 After the user fills the form that is provided to them, a date and time will be assigned and a meeting will be scheduled with the scrap dealer. The user can fell free to edit the meet later according to their luxury.
